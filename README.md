# Stopwatch Timer

## This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a stopwatch. 

### Functionality

When the user presses the green play button, the timer starts counting from 00:00:00 - adding 1 each time. When the user presses the orange pause button, the counter stops. The user can either press the green play button again, to resume, or the user can press the red reset button, to start the timer again from 00:00:00.
